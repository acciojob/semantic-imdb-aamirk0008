        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief, the best in the dangerous
          art of extraction: stealing valuable secrets from deep within the
          subconscious during the dream state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cobb is unable to visit his children, and is offered a chance to
          regain his life if he can accomplish the seemingly impossible task of
          inception: the implantation of another person's idea into a target's
          subconscious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cobb's team must navigate through multiple layers of dreams within
          dreams, facing projections from their target's subconscious and Cobb's
          own haunting memories.
